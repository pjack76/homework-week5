# homework-week5

the homework is to make a daily planner with timeblock turning one color if it's in the past, another color for the present, and a different color for the future.

i got the clock to show where is supposed to be.

my time blocks are all one color for whatever reason.

i got the local storage to work, but i could call the value so that it would stay on the page even after the page is refreshed.

no time for css.
